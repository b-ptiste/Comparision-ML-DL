# Comparision-ML-DL

The aim of these assigment is the make a 4 pages report to compare several algorithms.

## Assigment 1

he aim of this assignment will be to apply the theoretical knowledge learned during the course to concrete examples. This first assignment will use machine and deep learning methods to perform supervised multiclass classification. We will use the very popular MNIST dataset which corresponds to a set of handwritten numbers.

* SVM with and without PCA as pre-processing
* Random Forest
* Simple Neural Network (CNN)

## Assigment 2

The aim of this assignment is to follow up on the first assignment. It will also serve to apply the theoretical knowledge on a concrete example. This second assignment corresponds again to a supervised multi-class classification problem. This time we will use the CIFAR-10 1 dataset. I have also chosen for this assignment to do it on Python.
