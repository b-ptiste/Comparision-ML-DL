# Comparison-ML-DL

The goal of this work is to produce a 4 page report to compare several algorithms.

## Exercise 1

he goal of this assignment is to apply the theoretical knowledge learned during the course to concrete examples. This first assignment will use machine learning and deep learning methods to perform supervised multiclass classification. We will use the very popular MNIST dataset which corresponds to a set of handwritten numbers.

* SVM with and without PCA as pre-processing
* Random forest
* Simple neural network (CNN)

## Exercise 2

The purpose of this assignment is to follow up on the first assignment. It will also serve to apply the theoretical knowledge on a concrete example. This second assignment corresponds again to a supervised multi-class classification problem. This time, we will use the CIFAR-10 1 dataset. I have also chosen for this assignment to do it in Python.
